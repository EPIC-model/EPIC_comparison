This repository contains plotting scripts to analyse [EPIC](https://github.com/EPIC-model/epic) (and [PS3D](https://github.com/matt-frey/ps3d)) simulation data. The directory 0.13.1 has all scripts to generate the figures of [The 3D Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell (EPIC) method](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpx.2023.100136). Note that the Python tools (e.g. [nc_reader](https://github.com/EPIC-model/epic/blob/0.13.1/python-scripts/tools/nc_reader.py)) which are part of the general [EPIC](https://github.com/EPIC-model/epic/tree/0.13.1) repository are needed. Please use the corresponding EPIC release tag matching the directory name.
